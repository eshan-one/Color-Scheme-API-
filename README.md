# [LINK -> Color Scheme API Solo Project](https://eshan-color-api.netlify.app/)

This is a solo project that implements a Color Scheme API. It generates random color schemes based on a seed color provided by the user.

## Description

The Color Scheme API generates color schemes by making requests to thecolorapi.com. It takes a seed color as input and retrieves a scheme of colors related to that seed color.

The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: The HTML file for the color scheme generator UI.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the color scheme generator UI.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the functionality for generating color schemes and copying color values.

## Features

- Randomly generates color schemes based on a seed color provided by the user.
- Supports different color modes (e.g., monochrome, analogous, triad, etc.) for generating the color schemes.
- Allows users to copy the color values to the clipboard for easy use in other applications or workflows.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a seed color value in the input field.
3. Select a color mode from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Generate" button to generate a color scheme based on the provided seed color and color mode.
5. The generated color scheme will be displayed on the screen.
6. Click on any color box to copy its hexadecimal value to the clipboard.
